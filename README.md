# CartesianPlane-Triangle
 This command line program calculates the Perimeter and the Area of a Triangle by inserting the coordinates of A, B and C points, so on a Cartesian Plane.

## Usage
 - Insertion of coordinates for A, B and C points;
 - Decision to see the process carried out to obtain the Perimeter and the Area, "yes" to see it or any other answers to end the program;
 - "X" button to close.

## Note
 - Huge numbers will lead to an abnormal program status.

## Troubleshooting
 1. **When I type "yes" or something similar the program will end without showing the process.**
    This is because the program was written to make only "yes/Yes/YES" valid.
